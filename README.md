**Numpy** is a Python library essential for scientific computing, providing powerful tools for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
It offers a vast collection of mathematical functions and operations, making it indispensable for tasks like data analysis, machine learning and image pocessing.

This repository carries six files.
Each file is a jupiter notebook that contains the solved numpy problems of a specific topic.

The first file **numpy-arrays.ipynb** contains the array problems. Here, I have solved too many problems on arrays.
Arrays are of different dimensions like One-Dimension, Two-Dimension and Multi-Dimension are solved in this file.
Each and every line of the problem is explained clearly with the comments.

The second file **numpy-basics.ipynb** contains the most basic problems of numpy. In this file, I have solved many problems to learn the basics in numpy. This contains arrays, random number generator, linear algebra etc.
Basics are always required to solve many real life problems. Numpy basics teaches you the little little things which are generally required during your model building, fitting and predicting.

The third file **numpy-linear-algebra.ipynb** contains the problems of linear algebra. In this file, I have solved problems of linear algebra, like finding determinant, trace and diagonals of a matrix, etc.
Some of the machine learning models and deep learning models use linear algebra in their implementation.
So it is a compulsory thing who wants to be a data engineer, data scientist, ml engineer or ai engineer.

The fourth file **numpy-mathematics.ipynb** contains the problems related to mathematics. In this file problems are basically of type, finding the sum, difference, product, trigonometric values, etc
The mathematical concepts really helps a lot when you go for machine learning and deep learning. 
So please go through this mini material for mathematical things to learn.

The fifth file **numpy-random.ipynb** contains the problems of random generator. This is about generating the random numbers between 0 and 1, generating the random integers etc
This is most important in numpy, which makes creating random numbers easier. It helps a lot in solving various set of problems like generating a distribution, an array of different dimensions etc

The sixth file **numpy-statistics.ipynb** contains the statistic related questions. In this, I have solved and explained about mean, median, mode, average, standard deviation, variance etc. 
This also contains about different distributions available in numpy.

On an overall, this material helps you a lot in learning numpy. After going through this material you become an expert in numpy.
This taught me a lot in learning the basics, the advanced and the expert level numpy, to build my career.
